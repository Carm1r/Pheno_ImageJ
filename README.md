# Phenotyping tools and scripts for ImageJ

This repository contains our tools and scripts for image analysis using ImageJ

---

Script usage: To make scripts available as menu commands in ImageJ, it is
sufficient to put the script files into a _subfolder_ of `ImageJ.app/scripts/`.

---

## Functions included

1. CIELab_ROI: Calculate average CIELab L, a and b values for auto-identified ROIs in a 
picture: This script has been developed within the APPLECUT project for automated calculation 
of average color assessment of browning in fresh-cut apple slices. The script allows to set 
the minimum size (in pixels) that should be  considered in the automated ROI detection.
